# Stock-Market-Prediction-App
The Stock Market Prediction App aims to empower users with data-driven predictions, helping them understand the 
complexities of the stock market and make informed investment decisions.
The Stock Market Prediction model (LSTM) uses historical data to forecast future prices.It imports necessary 
libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and yfinance to collect and analyze data. The model preprocesses the 
data and calculates moving averages of closing prices to identify trends in order to predict future prices. 
Visualizations are displayed to help users understand predicted prices and stock trends. 
The LSTM model forecasts stock prices by splitting the data into training and testing sets, scaling data and
transforming it into input-output pairs, with necessary layers imported for model creation. The model is then 
created and trained for time series forecasting by initializing a sequential model with multiple LSTM layers,
dropout regularization, and the Adam optimizer to learn complex patterns and make accurate predictions.
The stock market predictor web application is built using Streamlit that utilizes machine learning and data 
analysis to forecast stock prices. It imports necessary libraries, loads LSTM model, and takes user input for 
stock symbols to retrieve historical data. Key features include stock data retrieval, moving averages, model
prediction, and visualization. The application provides valuable insights for informed investment decisions
and offers an interactive interface that enhances the overall user experience, facilitating intuitive navigation
and exploration of stock market trends and predictions.
